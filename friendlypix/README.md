# Friendly Pix iOS

Friendly Pix iOS is a sample app demonstrating how to build an iOS app with the Firebase Platform.

Friendly Pix is a place where you can share photos, follow friends, comment on photos...


## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

Friendly Pix iOS is built using Objective-C and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup). The Auth flow is built using [Firebase-UI](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios). Dependencies are managed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Additionally server-side micro-services are built on [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).

Simply install the pods and open the .xcworkspace file to see the project in Xcode.

```
$ pod install
$ open your-project.xcworkspace
```

## Create Firebase Project

1. To add the FriendlyPix app to a Firebase project, use the bundleID `com.google.firebase.friendlypix`.
1. Download the generated `GoogleService-Info.plist` file, and copy it to the root directory of this app.
